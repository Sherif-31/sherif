Step1: Input string from the user and store in a variable named as str. 
Step2: I take a variable "n=0" to n the frequency of each character. 
Step3: To go through every element i take outer for "i=0". 
Step4: Inner for loop "j=i+1" "(i=0;i<n;i++)". 
Step5: Initialize the second for lopp as "(j=i+1;j<n;j++)". 
Step6: Inside the for loop an if condition is applied to check the string until space(a[i]!=" "). 
Step7: Inside the if condition check if a[i]==a[j],if it is true then count gets increment(count++). 
Step8: After every time each character gets counted it prints the count of the element(printf("%s=%d",str,count)). 
Step9: After printing the frequency of the element the count value assign to 0.
